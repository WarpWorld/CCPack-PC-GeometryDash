- How `RLRouletteLayer::onDifficultyButton` handles stuff

- Dev macro (RWDI_MODE)
- Demon plus button visible in Demon List and Challenge List modes
- Weird static variable swap stuff in `RLConfirmationAlertLayer` and `RLIntegerInputLayer`
- Odd way of resetting all `CCMenuItemToggler`s after being toggled
- Clicking the level's name/creator/id not copying it to the clipboard
- Potential crash if `RLRouletteLayer::m_level` is empty (highly situational)
